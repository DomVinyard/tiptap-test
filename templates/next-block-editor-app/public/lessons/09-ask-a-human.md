# Ask a Human

## Understanding Human-in-the-Loop

While AI is incredibly powerful, there are times when human judgment, creativity, or expertise is invaluable. Wordware's Ask a Human feature lets you pause your flow at strategic points to gather human input before continuing. This creates a collaborative workflow where AI and humans work together to produce the best possible results.

## Creating Human Input Steps

Adding human input to your flow is straightforward. You'll use the `/human` command to create a pause point where human input is needed. Here's how to structure your human input requests effectively:

1. Set clear context
   ```
   /human
   Please review this blog post introduction and provide feedback on:
   - Tone and engagement
   - Key message clarity
   - Target audience alignment
   
   Content to review: @blogIntro
   ```

2. Define specific actions
   ```
   /human
   Based on the AI-generated image (@generatedImage), please:
   1. Choose the best color scheme (warm or cool)
   2. Suggest any composition adjustments
   3. Approve or request regeneration
   ```

3. Provide format guidance
   ```
   /human
   Review the product description (@productDesc) and provide your input as:
   APPROVE: If it's ready to use
   REVISE: Plus specific change requests
   REJECT: Plus reason for rejection
   ```

## Try It Yourself: Create a Content Review Flow

Let's build a practical flow that incorporates human input for content review and refinement.

1. Create the initial content generation:
   ```
   /input content_type (Text) "Type of content to generate (blog post, social media, email)"
   /input topic (Text) "Main topic or subject matter"
   
   Generate a draft @content_type about @topic that's informative and engaging.
   ```

2. Add the human review step:
   ```
   /human
   Please review this @content_type draft about @topic:

   Content to review:
   @draftContent

   Please provide your input in the following format:
   QUALITY (1-5):
   STRENGTHS:
   AREAS TO IMPROVE:
   SPECIFIC CHANGES:
   ```

3. Create the refinement step:
   ```
   Based on the human feedback (@humanFeedback), revise the content while maintaining 
   the original voice and incorporating the suggested improvements.
   ```

<Quiz 
  questions={[{
    question: 'Have you created the content review flow with human input?',
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    options: [
      { id: 'yes', text: 'âœ“ Yes, I have created a flow that combines AI generation with human review', isCorrect: true }
    ],
    successMessage: "Great work! You've created a flow that effectively combines AI capabilities with human expertise for better content creation."
  }]} 
  onComplete={() => {}} 
/>

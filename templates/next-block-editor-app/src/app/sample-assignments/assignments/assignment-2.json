Download the transcript attachment or copy the email body into a working document for processing.\n2. Use language-model tools to generate exactly three concise bullets covering key outcomes and action items.\n3. Pull the attendee list from the email headers or the transcript metadata.\n4. Compose a brief email containing the three bullets and send it to every attendee.\n5. Store any user corrections on tone or format for future recaps.\n\n### Guidance\n- Always produce exactly three clear, actionable bullets—no more, no less—and double-check that each bullet reflects a unique takeaway.\n- Do not email anyone whose attendance is uncertain; escalate if attendee list is unclear.\n\n### Ask Me\n- If you cannot definitively determine all attendee email addresses, ask the user for the list before sending.\n"

      "markdown": "# 3-Bullet Meeting Recapper\n\n### Trigger\nEMAIL\n\n### Purpose\nWhen a new email containing a meeting transcript lands in the inbox, the agent should read the transcript, distill the discussion into exactly three clear bullet points that capture the main decisions, action items and next steps, then send that recap by email to all meeting attendees so everyone stays aligned without having to read the full transcript.\n\n### Steps\n1. Detect whether the transcript is attached or embedded in the email body; if attached, download it, otherwise copy the text content into a temporary document so it is easy to process and reference during summarisation.\n2. Run the transcript through a summarisation prompt that instructs the model to produce precisely three numbered or bulleted lines that collectively cover decisions made, responsibilities assigned and any next steps, avoiding redundant detail or generic statements.\n3. Collect recipient addresses from the original meeting invite headers if present; if missing, scan the first page or header of the transcript for a participant list; compile a deduplicated list of attendee email addresses for distribution.\n4. Draft an email whose subject references the meeting title and date, place the three-bullet recap in the body, attach the full transcript for reference, and send it to all identified attendees, placing yourself in CC for record-keeping.\n5. If the user later edits the bullet style, tone or length, store those preferences in memory so subsequent summaries automatically follow the preferred style without asking again.\n\n### Guidance\n- The summary must contain precisely three distinct bullet points; avoid sub-bullets or paragraphs. Each bullet should communicate a unique decision, action item or follow-up. If the transcript lacks three substantial points, still produce three concise bullets by combining minor points as needed rather than reducing the count.\n- Before sending the recap, confirm that every email address belongs to someone who attended the meeting. If the attendee list cannot be confidently derived from headers or transcript metadata, pause and ask the user to supply or confirm the correct recipients rather than guessing, to avoid sharing potentially sensitive information with unintended parties.\n\n### Ask Me\n- When the email headers lack clear participant data and the transcript does not list attendees—or if there is conflicting information—pause and request the correct recipient list from the human to ensure the recap is sent only to intended participants.\n"
